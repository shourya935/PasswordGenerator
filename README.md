# PasswordGenerator

Built a responsive Password Generator using React and Tailwind CSS to dynamically generate secure passwords based on user preferences. Gained hands-on experience with React hooks like useState for managing state, useEffect for handling side effects, and useCallback to optimize function rendering. Used useRef to interact with the DOM and copy content to the clipboard. This project deepened my understanding of component styling, state-driven UI updates, and performance optimization in React.
